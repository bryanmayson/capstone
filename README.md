# GPU Acceleration of Raster Filters on Elevation Maps with OpenCL
Eduard is a software developed by Monash and Zurich Monash FIT and ETH Zurich to aid cartographers in applying various filters onto elevation maps.

The project involves integrating the current linear time software coded in the Java language with OpenCL such that the overall computational process of applying the raster filters can be exponentially reduced.
